Hey! 👋

## The Process 

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the project and the project’s maintainers are here to help you get your changes merged.

While we’re cool with “blind PRs”, it’s always best to provide some context:
- Either in the PR itself.
- A related issues.
- Or by first opening a new issues and proposing your changes.
  
If you plan on doing something that will take a lot of work, it’s best to discuss it first. We don’t want you to waste your time.

## Technical Notes

- Don’t submit PRs that don’t pass tests. (`yarn test`)
- When committing, use `yarn commit` and follow the instructions.
